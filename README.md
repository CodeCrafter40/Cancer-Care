## Project Overview for "Enhancing Cancer Care Solution - Healthcare Industry"

### Project Title:
**Enhancing Cancer Care Solution**

### Industry:
**Healthcare**

### Description:
Partnering with Seattle Information Systems Inc., I developed an innovative solution for the Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA). This project focused on integrating patient-reported outcomes with electronic health records (EHR) to significantly enhance cancer care efficiency and patient engagement.

### What the Product is All About:
The primary objective was to seamlessly integrate patient-reported outcomes into the existing EHR system, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of healthcare plans. This integration allows healthcare providers to personalize treatment plans based on real-time patient data.

### Key Features:
- **Data Collection:** Utilized the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) to gather comprehensive symptom information directly from cancer patients.
- **Deployment on Apple iPads:** iPads were deployed as the primary interface, offering mobility and ease of use for accessing critical information at the bedside or any point of care within the hospital.
- **Unique Identification and Access:** Digital wristbands were used for secure and seamless patient logins, eliminating manual entry errors and ensuring data accuracy.
- **Integration with AllScripts EHR:** A robust HL7 interface was developed to ensure seamless data integration with the AllScripts EHR system.
- **Enterprise-Level Deployment:** The solution was hosted in an on-premises data center at the primary CTCA hospital, making it accessible from any CTCA facility.
- **Smart Printing:** The system included an algorithm for automatic printer selection, directing documents to the nearest printer to the concerned physician, thereby streamlining operations and reducing time waste.

### Integrations and Tech Stack:
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Backend:** Java EE
  - **Frontend:** ReactJS
  - **Database:** MySQL
  - **Hosting/Infrastructure:** AWS Server
  - **Integration:** HL7 interface for AllScripts EHR
  - **Data Collection Interface:** Apple iPads and digital wristbands for patient identification and data collection

### Challenges:
CTCA aimed to efficiently collect patient-reported outcomes and integrate these insights seamlessly into their existing EHR system. The goal was to enhance patient care without disrupting established clinical workflows, ensuring that patient experiences and outcomes directly inform care strategies. The client sought to set a new standard in personalized healthcare.

### My Contribution:
- **Backend Development:** Worked extensively with Java EE, particularly focusing on developing the HL7 interface for EHR integration.
- **Frontend Development:** Contributed to building the user interface using ReactJS, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- **Infrastructure Management:** Assisted in setting up and managing the infrastructure on AWS Servers.

### Impact Created:
- **Enhanced Patient Care:** Provided physicians with real-time symptom reports, enabling personalized care and dynamic treatment adjustments.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced manual data entry, minimized administrative burdens, and decreased the potential for errors.
- **Increased Patient Engagement:** Enabled patients to directly report symptoms, fostering better involvement and understanding of their treatment process.
- **Scalability:** The enterprise-level deployment allowed for easy expansion to additional facilities without the need for new installations.

### Conclusion:
In collaboration with Seattle Information Systems Inc., I delivered a transformative solution for CTCA that streamlined operations and elevated patient care. By leveraging innovative technologies and integrating with established systems like AllScripts EHR, this project exemplifies the potential of tech-driven healthcare solutions.
